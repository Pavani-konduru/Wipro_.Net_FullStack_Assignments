                         Graph Algorithm
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Graphs:
********
--> A graph can be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices. 
--> A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.
--> A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices.

Components of a Graph:
---------------------
Vertices: Vertices are the basic units of the graph used to represent real-life objects, persons, or entities. Sometimes, vertices are also known as Nodes.
Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two vertices of the graph. Sometimes, edges are also known as Arcs.

Types of Graphs:
----------------
The Graphs can be categorized into two types:

	1. Undirected Graph
	2. Directed Graph
Undirected Graph:- 
-----------------
	A Graph with edges that do not have a direction is termed an Undirected Graph. The edges of this graph imply a two-way relationship in which each edge can be traversed in both directions. 
Directed Graph: 
---------------
	A Graph with edges with direction is termed a Directed Graph. The edges of this graph imply a one-way relationship in which each edge can only be traversed in a single direction.

What are Weighted Graphs?
--------------------------
A Graph is said to be Weighted if each edge is assigned a 'weight'. The weight of an edge can denote distance, time, or anything that models the 'connection' between the pair of vertices it connects.

Dijkstra Algorithm:-
*********************
* Dijkstra's Algorithm is a Graph algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in the Graph (single source shortest path). 
* It is a type of Greedy Algorithm that only works on Weighted Graphs having positive weights. 
* The time complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm is O(V2) with the help of the adjacency matrix representation of the graph. 
* This time complexity can be reduced to O((V + E) log V) with the help of an adjacency list representation of the graph.
* where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

--> This is the single source shortest path problem.
--> if we have a weighted graph is given inside that we have to find the smallest or shortest path from one starting vertex (node) to all other vetex (nodes).
--> The smallest or shortest path can be direct to the vertex (node) or that can be indirect means having selected multiple nodes.
--> Since we are finding the smallest path. so, this is a minimization problem.
--> Minimization is a optimization problem.
--> Optimization problem can be solved by greedy method.
--> Greedy method says that a problem must be solved in stages by taking one step at a time, that includes one input at a time.
--> we will get an optimization solution.
--> In greedy we have procedure defined and by use of that we will gonna get the optimize solution.

Source Node (or) Vertex:-
--------------------------
--> Starting node for finding the shortest or smallest path.
--> Any node from the graph can be the source or starting vertex.

Relaxation:-
-----------
      This is the discarding of the largest value with a small value when we are coming from indirect node or vertex to find the shortest path.

Drawback:
---------
Drawback of this algorithm--> For Negative value of weighted graph tis algorithm may or may not work.

Dynamic Approach:
-----------------
	A Graph in which we have the cycle this dynamic approach will be better to find the smallest or shortest path.
	To calculate the smallest or shortest path between two pair of nodes or vertex.
